Website idea

Similar existing applications: IMDb, MyAnimeList, 

Purpose: 
Provide users with the ability to rate and recommend movies they’ve watched.

Functions:
Primary:
Rate movie. (5 stars or grade out of 10)
Recommend or not.
Comment
To watch list.
Other main functions:
Specific rating system (rating aspects of movie such as plot, characters, acting, effects and more.) → these specific ratings could be out of 5, and then the total rating for the movie could be generated as an average of all categories.
Limits user options for total rating? Allow modification of total rating value?
Have specific and quick rating function, quick rating function allows for a quick total rating without detailed ratings of movie aspects.
Advanced/in depth stats for each user’s watched movie list (and overall ratings)
Ability to sort based on genre, actor, director, release date (time period) etc.
Cool ‘recap’ stats for your watchlist (Per year and overall)
Most seen actor/actress
Most seen director
Most liked genre
Top 10 overall lists 
Distribution of movies over rating
Distribution of movies by genre
Allow users to friend/follow others, see their ratings of movies and recommendations. 
Recommend movies to user based on ratings of others movies, friends’ recommendations, preferred genres, language, actors, directors, etc. (Would require big algorithm, could assign importance values to each considered aspect and then compare movies with that idk).
Playlists? Recommended watching order? (Collections? → Harry potter collection for example).
Connect user account with streaming services:
Allows for syncing of watched movies.
Data sharing, receive watched movies and other similar data (i.e. most commonly watched genre [we can determine that ourselves]). Give: recommended movies by friends and other rating/satisfaction data.
Have quick and easy buttons to watch a recommended movie (i.e. watch on “Streaming Service” now!).
Complications:
Where/how are we coding this?
Obtaining movie database (with genre, length, +more).
Hosting said website/servers.
Creating an algorithm capable of recommending movies.
